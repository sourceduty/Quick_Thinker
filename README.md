Quick Thinker is a fast-paced letter and word guessing game designed to test the player's speed and accuracy. The game starts by presenting the player with instructions that explain the rules and objectives. Once the player begins, the game randomly selects a word from a predefined list of words. From this chosen word, a random initial letter is displayed to the player.

The player's task is to guess the entire word within 5 seconds, starting with the displayed initial letter. If the player successfully guesses the word within the time limit, they earn a point. However, if the player fails to guess the word correctly or time runs out, they lose the round. The game continues with new words and initial letters until the player decides to quit.

Each correct guess earns the player a point, and the objective is to achieve the highest score possible. The game provides continuous gameplay that challenges the player's vocabulary, speed, and quick-thinking skills. With its random selection of words, random presentation of initial letters, and time limit for each guess, Quick Thinker offers an engaging and entertaining experience for players looking to test their mental agility.
